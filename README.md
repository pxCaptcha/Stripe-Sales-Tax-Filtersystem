# Stripe-Sales-tax-Filtersystem

What is this program doing?
A tax sales filter system for Stripe, where your exported sales in a csv, would filter you out that for example 21 people out of Italy paid 495,34â‚¬ this month and for Germany 23 people paid * and so going on...
With this you can do your tax really easy, as for example in Germany and in many other countries you need to protocol how many people from where paid how much and pay instead of 19% sales tax for your country, then 21% then to Italy for the people coming out of Italy as the sales tax is 21% there instead of 19%. With this you can clearly oversee already directly how much from where how much money you made, and with this you can calculate your sales tax super easy.
