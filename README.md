# Stripe-Sales-tax-Filtersystem

What is this program doing?
A tax sales filter system for Stripe, where your exported sales in a csv, would filter you out that for example 21 people out of Italy paid 495,34â‚¬ this month and for people paid * etc.
With this you can do your tax really easy as for example in Germany you need to tell the state how many people from where paid how much and pay instead of 19% sales tax, 21% then to Italy. With this you can clearly oversee already directly how much from where and how much you need to pay
